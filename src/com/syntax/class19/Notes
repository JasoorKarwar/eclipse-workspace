Constructors:
1)It is a special block of code/similar to a method that is executed when we create an object
of a class
2) The purpose of constructors is to initialize our fields.
3) They must have the same name as the name of the class
4) Constructors do not have return types not even void
5) we can pass arguments to our constructors just like we do for our methods
